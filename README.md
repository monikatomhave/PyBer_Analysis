# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5

Overview of the analysis:

Showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with with a bubble chart; bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
Also, determine the mean, median, and mode for the total number of rides for each city type, the average fares for each city type and the total number of drivers for each city type.
Using box-and-whisker plots to determine if there are any outliers for the number of rides for each city type, the fares for each city type and the number of drivers for each city type.
Using pie chart to represent data for each city type: The percent of total fares, the percent of total rides and the percent of total drivers.


Results:

Total Rides: 
Rural        125
Suburban     625
Urban       1625

Total Drivers:
Rural         78
Suburban     490
Urban       2405

Total Fares by city type:

Rural       $ 4327.93
Suburban   $ 19356.33
Urban      $ 39854.38

Average Fare per ride:
Rural       $34.62
Suburban    $30.97
Urban       $24.53

Averge fare per driver:
Rural       $55.49
Suburban    $39.50
Urban       $16.57

Overall the urban area generates nine time smore money than the rural cities.  There are thirty times more drivers available in urban cities versus rural cities. There are also thirteen times more rides given in urban cities than rural cities.  Since those numbers are so different in size, it is not surprising that the cost per ride in a rural city costs $10 more on average than a ride in the urban cities.  THe average fare per driver for rural cities is over three times as much as that for the urban cities.  With the rides being more utilized in urban area, the cost of the ride goes down.  The driver's cound be paid more if the company keeps the same rate for all rides.  Or if the company pays all drivers the same, then the profit would be a lot more from the urban cities.  

Summary:
There is probably a need for rural ride share, but the cost is a lot higher for the comapny to maintain those drivers and the fares for the riders are much higher per ride.  It looks like the fares really went up the third week of February, so I would recommend keeping drivers available around that time of the month.  January was not very high at all.  It looks like in urban areas, fares went up one week and down the next throughout february and march. I would look at why.  Was it nice weather?  Was it payday weekend, so people could afford it one week and not the next?  By summer time, end of April to May it looks like fares in all three areas were trending down or the same.
